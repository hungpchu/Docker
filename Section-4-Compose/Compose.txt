Docker Compose
1. Scenario
    - if we need to set up a complex application running multiple services
2. With Docker Compose, we can
    - create a configuration file in Yaml format called docker-compose.yml and
    - put together different services and the option specific to those to running them in this file and 
    - run docker-compose up to run the whole application stack
    - but only applicable to running containers on a single Docker host 

docker-compose up
1. bring up the whole application
2. assume the images are built
