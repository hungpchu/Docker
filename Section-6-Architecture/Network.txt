Docker Network
1. When installing Docker, it creates 3 networks
    - Bridge
        1. is the default network that the container get attached tos
        2. come with: docker run ubuntu
        3. is a private internal network created by Docker on the host
        4. All the containers attached to this network by default
            - each will get an internal IP address in the range 172.17
            - each can access each other using this internal IP
    - None
        1. can come with: docker run ubuntu --network=none
        2. container will
            - not attach to any network or 
            - not have access to the external network or other containers
            - run on the isolated network
    - Host
        1. can come with: docker run ubuntu --network=host
        2. dont have to do port mapping and 
        3. brings about the any network isolation between the docker host and docker container
        4. web container will use the host network
        5. but can not run multiple web containers on the same host on the same port as the port is now common to all containers in the host network

User-defined network
1. create our own internal network using the command
    - docker network create \
        --driver bridge \
        --subnet 182.18.0.0/16 \
        custom-isolated-network

docker network ls command
1. to list all networks

Inspect network
1. docker inspect <imageID>
2. under "Network"

Embedded DNS
1. All containers in the docker host can resolve each other with the name of the container
2. Docker has the built in DNS server that helps the container to resolve each other using the container name
3. built in DNS server always run at address 127.0.0.11

How can Docker isolate containers within the Docker host?
1. Docker uses network namespace that create a seperate namespace for each container
2. Then use virtual Ethernet pairs to connect containers together
