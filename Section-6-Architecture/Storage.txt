How Docker stores data on the local file system

File system
1. When installing Docker on a system, it
    - creates a folder structure at /var/lib/docker
    - you will have multiple folders under it called
        - aufs, containers, image
2. How does Docker store the file/container?
    - When docker build image, it build these in a layered architecture
    - can take the already built layer from the cache to build the new image
        - is faster and save disk space

Volume mouting
1. mount a directory from the volume directory
docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql
2. For example:
    1. build and run a containers out of mysql image
    2. create a folder data_volume under volume folder under /var/lib/docker and
    3. store all the date there
    4. When the container is gone then the data is still persisted


docker volume create data_volume
1. just create a folder data_volume under volume folder under /var/lib/docker

Bind mount
1. mount a directory from any location on the docker host
2. docker run -v <absolutePathToLocation>:/var/lib/mysql mysql
    - can be written like this:
        docker run --mount type=bind,source=<absolutePathToLocation>,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql

Storage Driver
1. Used by Docker to enable layered architecture
