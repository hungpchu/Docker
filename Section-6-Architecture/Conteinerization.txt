Containerization
1. Docker uses namespace to isolate workplace like
    - process id, network, mount, Unix Timesharing

Namespace - PID
1. When the Linux system boots up, it start with running many process
2. When creating a container (like a child system) within the current system, the child system needs to think that it 
    - is an independent system on its own
    - has its own set of processes originating from a root process with a process ID of 1
    - process runninng in the container is the process running in the underlying host
3. all processes are running on the same host but seperated into their own container with different PID base on container
