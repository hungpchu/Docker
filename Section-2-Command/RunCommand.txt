Run Command
1. docker run <imageName>:<versionNumber>
    - run the image with the specific version
2. does not listen to the standard input
    - include -i (interactive mode) after run to specific the value
3. have -it after the run for the terminal plus interactive mode

Port Mapping
1. have a web application in a docker container on docker host
    - docker host/engine = underlying host where Docker is installed
    - when we run the web then we can see the server is running
    - But how the user access our application
        - if the application listens on port 5000 then what IP will I use for web browser?
            1. Use the IP of the container
                - Every docker container has the IP assigned but it is internal IP and can only accessed within the docker host -> external user can not access it
            2. Use the IP of the docker host
                - For working then have to map the port inside of the docker container to a free port on the docker host
                - can map port 5000 of the docker container to the free port 80 of the docker host
                - Usage: docker run -p 80:5000 webapp
                - can run multiple instance of your application and map them to different ports on the docker host
                - can not map the same port on the docker host more than 1

Volume mapping
1. How data is persisted in the docker container
2. For instance 
    - running docker run mysql
    - when databases and tables are created
        - the data files are stored in location /var/lib/mysql inside the docker container
        - the docker container has its own isolated file system and any changes to any files happens within the container
        - let's say you wanna dump many datas in the database, what happens if deleting the mysql container and remove it?
            - all the data and container are gone
            - if you want to persist the data then 
                - map a directory outside the container on the docker host to the directory inside the container like /opt/datadir for instance to the internal directory /var/lib/mysql in the docker container
                - Map command: docker run -v /opt/datadir:/var/lib/mysql mysql
                    - will mount the external directory to a folder inside the docker container
                    - all the data will be 
                        - stored in the external volume
                        - remained even if you delete the docker container

docker inspect <containerName>/<containerID> command
1. will inspect the container
2. see more details about container

docker logs <containerName>/<containerID> command
1. see the logs

docker run --link <containerName>:<containerNameToLink> 
1. run and link container together
