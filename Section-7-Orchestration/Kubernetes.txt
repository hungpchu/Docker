1. With Docker, we can run a single instance of an application using the docker CLI by running docker run command

Kubernetes Overview
1. With Kubernetes, using the Kubernetes CLI (kube control), you can
    - run many instances of the same application with a single command
        - run kubectl run --replicas=1000 <imageName>
    - Kubernetes can configured to scale up and down based on user load
2. uses Dokcer hosts to host applications in the form of Docker containers

Kubernetes architecture
1. is cluster consisting a set of nodes
    - Node is 
        - a physical or virtual machine installed Kubernetes inside
        - a worker machine where container will be launched by Kubernetes
    - What if the node fails?
        - we need more than 1 node
    - Cluster is
        - a set of nodes grouped together
    - who is responsible for managing this cluster?
        - The Master
            - is 
                - a node with the Kubernetes control plane components installed
                - responsible for the actual orchestration of containers on the worker nodes
            - watches over the nodes in the cluster

Installing Kubernetes
1. will install these components
    - API Server
        1. acts as the front end for Kubernetes
        2. CLI talks to the API server to interact with the component cluster
    - etcd
        1. is a distributed reliable key value store
        2. store all data used to manage the cluster
        3. responsible for implementing logs within the cluster to ensure
            - there are no conflict between the masters
    - kubelet
        1. is the agent that 
            - runs on each node in the cluster
            - makes sure that the containers are running on the nodes as expected
    - Container runtime
        1. run containers
    - Controller
        1. responsible for noticing and responding when 
            - nodes/containers/endpoint close down
            - bring up new containers in the case 
    - Scheduler
        1. distributing works or containers across multiple nodes
        2. looks for newly created containers and 
        3. assign them to nodes

kubectl
1. is the Kubernetes CLI
2. used to deploy and manages applications on the Kubernetes cluster
