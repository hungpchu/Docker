Docker Orchestration
1. With Docker, we can run a single instance of the application on the single docker host
2. What if the number of users increases and we want to increase the number of intances?
    - If manually do run command then you have to provision
    - what if the docker host crashed and the health is not good?
        - container Orchestration is the solution

Container Orchestration
1. consists of 
    - a set of tools and script that can
        - help host containers in a production environment
    - multiple docker hosts that can host containers
        - even if 1 host fail then the application is still accessible through the other container
2. can deploy many of instances of application using a single command
    - used for Docker Swarm
3. multiple container solution orchestration today like
    - docker swarm
        - easy to start but
        - lack some of advanced auto scaling feature
    - kubernetes
        - is supported on all public cloud services
    - Mesos
