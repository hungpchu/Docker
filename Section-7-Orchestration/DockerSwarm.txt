Docker Swarm Overview
1. With this, you can combine multiple Docker machines together into a single cluster Docker
2. take care distributing your services or application instances into separate hosts for high availability and load balancing across different systems and hardware


Set up Docker Swarm
1. must have hosts or multiple hosts with Docker installed on them
2. must designate one host to be the manager or master (swarm manager) and other as slave or workers
3. Once done then run docker swarm init command on the swarm manager
    - this will init the swarm manager
    - provide the command to run on the worker
    - run the command on the worker to join the manager
    - after joining the swarm, the workers are also referred to as nodes and 
    - you are now ready to create services and deploy them on the swarm cluster
4. Now we can create a swarm cluster, how can we utilize cluster to run multiple instances?
    1. 1st way: run the docker run command on each worker node
        - not idealistic
    2. 2nd way: use Docker Swarm Orchestration
        - the key component is the docker service
        - docker services are 1 or more instances of a single application that run across the nodes in the swarm cluster
            - we can create a docker service to run multiple instances of my web server application across worker nodes in my swarm cluster
            - run docker service create --replicas=3 <imageName> command on the manager node will create 3 running instances of <imageName>
