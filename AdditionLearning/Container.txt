Container Image
1. lightweight, stand alone executable package of software  
    - that includes everything needed to run an application, including bare bone OS
2. is a read-only template
3. is immutable, once built then can not be changed
    - If you need to change then have to build a new container image
Container
1. running instance of the container image

Benefits of container
1. consistent
    - can not be changed and will behave the same in any environments
2. Portability
    - can run anywhere where you have the container runtime environment installed (Docker)
3. Versioned
    - container image is built using a Docker file
    - Docker file
        - is a text file which can be checked in your code repository
4. Secure
    - when openning, all ports are closed

Virtual Machine
1. have a single OS and only 1 application

Container
1. Share the host OS and kernel
2. Can run dozen of containers on a single host with dozen of application running on that host
3. A single container should only perform a single function
