Images
1. Every docker image must be based off another image
    - either an OS or another image that was created
2. From the dockerfile, docker builds the image in the layer architectures
    - each line of instruction creates a new layer in the Docker image with just the change from the previous layer
    - For example in the dockerfile in this folder
        - Layer 1: base ubuntu layer
        - Layer 2: changes in apt packages
        - Layer 3: changes in pip packages
        - Layer 4: Copy the source code over
        - Update entrypoint with flask command

3. docker login command
    - login with docker credentials for pushing image to docker hub

4. docker push <dockerUserName/imageName> command
    - push the image to the dockerhub
