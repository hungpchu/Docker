Environment Variable
1. docker run -e APP_COLOR=blue simple-webapp-color
    - tag -e will have help set the Environment Variable APP_COLOR to be blue

Inspect Environment Variable
1. docker inspect <containerName>
    - Under "Env"

CMD in dockerfile
1. stands for command
2. defines the program that will be run within the container when it starts
    - bash as the value will be
        - a shell that listens for input from a terminal if it cannot find a terminal then it will exit
3. the command line parameter will get replaced entirely

From the dockerfile.txt in this folder
1. When running the ubuntu container, docker
    - create a container from the Ubuntu image and
    - launches the bash program
2. By default, docker not attach a terminal to a container when it runs
    - bash program not find the terminal and
    - it exits since the process that was started when the container was created
    - finish the container exits the process as well
3. How to specify a different command to star the container?
    1. Append the command to the docker run command
        - will override the default command specify in the image
        - For instance: docker run ubuntu sleep 5
            - how to make the above command perminent?
                - Include the instuction below in the dockerfile
                       FROM ubuntu
                       CMD sleep 5/ ["sleep","5"]

ENTRYPOINT
1. is the command instruction
2. the argument input or the command line parameter will be appended to the entry point
3. can use --entrypoint to override the value of default ENTRYPOINT

USING BOTH ENTRYPOINT AND CMD
1. FROM Ubuntu
    ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
    CMD ["5"]
2. sleep 5 will be default in case no command line argument input
3. in case there is command line argument then sleep <argumentInput>
