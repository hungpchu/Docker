Docker Overview

1. Why do you need Docker?
    - MERN application framework
        - MongoDB
        - ExpressJS
        - ReactJS
        - NodeJS
    - For example:
        - Have to install dependency for MERN stack application from end to end
            -> have to ensure the compatible with the OS version
            -> if the version is updated overtime then have to make sure the overall underlying infrastructure works as expect
    - compatible/dependency
    - long set up time
    - different dev/test/prod environments

2. What can Docker do?
    - Have each component in MERN running in seperate container with its own dependencies and libraries
        - all on the same VM and OS but within seperate environments or container
        -> Containerize applications 
    - Can start building the docker configuration once and 
    - all developers can get started with simple Docker run command
        -> Run each service with its own dependencies in seperate containers
